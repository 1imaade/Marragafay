## üîç WHAT WAS THE ISSUE?

The HTML structure was copied perfectly, but **CSS and JavaScript files were not linked** in the destination pages. This is like having a car with all the parts but no fuel - the structure is there but it can't work without the styling and functionality.

**Why it happened:**
- Homepage (`index.html`) has all CSS/JS files in `<head>` and footer
- When sections are copied to other pages, those pages need the **same CSS/JS dependencies**
- Each section requires specific stylesheets to display correctly

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION SUMMARY

**What was needed:**
1. Link the required CSS files in the `<head>` section
2. Link the required JavaScript files in the footer
3. Maintain the exact same order as homepage for compatibility

**Now all 3 sections display and function exactly like on the homepage!**
